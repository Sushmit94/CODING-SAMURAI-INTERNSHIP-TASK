# 🧠 Basic Python Projects – Coding Samurai Internship

Welcome to the repository containing my initial hands-on projects completed as part of my internship with **Coding Samurai**. These beginner-level tasks helped me build confidence in Python logic, algorithms, and user interaction flow.

---

## 📁 Projects Included

### 1. 🎮 Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Minimax Algorithm)
A terminal-based Tic-Tac-Toe game where the player (X) competes against an AI (O). The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm** to make optimal moves and never lose.

#### Features:
- Python-based 3x3 board game
- AI move selection using recursive minimax logic
- Draw, win, and lose detection
- Interactive CLI for player moves

#### Run:
```bash
python tictactoe.py


2. Customer Support Chatbot
A simple rule-based chatbot that simulates basic customer service interactions. Designed as a beginner project during my internship with @Coding Samurai, this chatbot uses regex-based intent matching to recognize and respond to common user queries.

🚀 Features
🤝 Greets the user and initiates an interactive conversation

🧠 Recognizes and responds to queries like:

📦 Product information

🔁 Return policies

🛠 Technical support

💬 General help inquiries

❌ Supports exit commands (e.g., "bye", "exit", "quit") to gracefully end the conversation

🔧 Modular and easy to extend for new intents or features

🖥 Run Instructions
bash
Copy
Edit
python chatbot.py
🧱 Purpose
This chatbot marks a foundational step in my journey into AI-driven automation and natural language interaction. Though basic, it helped me understand:

Core concepts of intent detection

Regex-based pattern matching

Simple state-driven conversation design

These are essential building blocks for more advanced NLP systems and customer service bots.

📚 Tech Stack
🐍 Python 3.x

re module for regular expressions and pattern detection

(Also used: math module in the Tic-Tac-Toe AI project for Minimax logic)

🔖 Acknowledgments
Special thanks to @Coding Samurai for providing a practical and beginner-friendly internship experience focused on real-world problem-solving.

🌱 Future Scope
🖼️ Add a GUI interface using Tkinter or PyQt

🧠 Integrate an NLP engine (e.g., spaCy, transformers) for smarter intent detection

🗂️ Implement conversation logging or session tracking

🌐 Deploy the chatbot as a web-based service using Flask or FastAPI
